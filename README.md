# LakeShore372Datalogger

This software provides a customizable datalogger for the Lake Shore Model 372 low temperature resistance bridge.

### Scope

The datalogger can transfer datapoints over Ethernet from the device to a computer. These datapoints are then aggregated (i.e. averaged), plotted and logged to disk.
Temperature can be inferred from the data with calibration coefficients / functions.
Currently only the scanner channels are supported, but future versions will add the control input and heaters.
